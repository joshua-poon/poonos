        <h2>Hello there. Welcome to my personal blog!</h2>

        <p>I'm Josh, a second year medical student from Australia. On this blog, I write
            about my various interests,
            such as linguistics and programming, the VCE, which I performed well in, and random opinion pieces.
            Outside of co-curricular academic endeavours, I work at a GP Clinic and a Pharmacy, and volunteer for the <a
                href="https://www.resn.org.au"> Regional Education Support Network
                (RESN)</a>, which provides free support for regional VCE students.</p>

        <p>Enjoy my blog, I hope you will!</p>

        <h2><a href="/covid">COVID Log</a></h2>

        <p>I've been tracking my journey during the COVID-19 pandemic as a high school student, university medical
            student and a non-clinical
            healthcare worker in Melbourne, Australia.</p>

        <h2><a href="/medicine">Medicine</a></h2>

        <p>I had always wanted to be a train driver when I was younger, but now my destiny is to be a doctor. Check out
            my
            thoughts on the content and the course, as well as the perspective of a health
            worker. </p>

        <h2><a href="/Languages">Languages</a></h2>

        <p>My complete guides to Latin and French. Vital Chinese healthcare
            phrases. Observations on the English language and the evolution of scripts. The importance of
            language learning. History of Medical Language. Medical Etymology Instagram Page: <a

        <h2><a href="/projects">Programming</a></h2>
        <p>
            Furthermore, I've dabbled in programming language for a very long time. I'm still a novice but I'm
            hoping to gain skills that will help in medical research. I use python for Competitive Programming and
            Jekyll static site generator to build this blog.

        <h2><a href="/nostalgia">Nostalgia</a></h2>

        <p>Finally, there's
            the
            personal archives, titled 'Nostalgia', where I post things like reviews of films I've watched, things I've
            owned, TV shows I liked when I was young, objects and pictures that bring back memories of primary school
            etc.

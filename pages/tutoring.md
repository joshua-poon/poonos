**Latin Tutoring Credentials 2022**

I now mainly exclusively tutor Latin, while balancing two part time jobs in retail and healthcare, music, sport, church, social and academic commitments.
- I have a broad experience in teaching Latin, teaching it from a beginner level, such as helping students to pick up the language, to VCE Unit 3/4 Level.
- I am well acquainted with all books of the Aeneid, which is the text studied in VCE Unit 4, and am highly proficient in all aspects of the language required for Latin unseens. 
- I have a range of resources such as notes, practice questions and sample unseens.
- I have a depth of knowledge of the structure of both the Oxford and Cambridge Latin courses, having taught from both extensively
- I love what Latin has taught me, and did it because I'm passionate about language learning, not just for the scaling! I'm proficient in French and am currently studying German.
- I love history and seeing the connections between language and culture in a classical context.

People often think that Latin is a dead language - but it's not because it lives on through the modern languages it has evolved into and influenced, as well in religious culture and in scientific language!

**Testimonials from 2021**

Josh is an excellent tutor who has extensive knowledge, understanding and interest in Maths Methods and English Language and he supported me greatly throughout VCE especially during remote learning. He helped me significantly to improve and gain confidence within my subjects in year 12 as he was easily able to adapt lessons to cater to my specific concerns and focus on my weaknesses by helping me understand and rectify my mistakes. Josh provided me with many resources throughout the year such as notes, practise sacs and exam revision materials. Josh is also very kind and I felt comfortable asking questions as he was always happy to re-explain any concepts that I found difficult. He was flexible with class times and I was able to contact and receive help and detailed feedback from him outside of class times. Thanks to Josh I was able to really enjoy my subjects this year and was also able to achieve rank 1 at my school for English language this year which would not have been possible without his teaching and advice.

I started with Joshua during the summer school holidays and we had begun from the start. Everything we covered even from the start to the end had a significant impact on my understanding and knowledge of methods. We were able to meet quite frequently when possible and I began to become more confident as time went on. I really couldn’t recommend Joshua enough! His accolades prove so and is a super nice person very approachable and useful to ask for any questions regarding how to improve as a student and with any questions you may get stuck with! Also provided me with useful notes and cas tricks school hadn’t shown me!

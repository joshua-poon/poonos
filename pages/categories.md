I write on a range of categories which span my interests, including pretty academic stuff, and random stuff like film reviews and what I think of the ABC.

<h3><a href="/covid">COVID Log</a></h3>

I've been tracking my journey during the COVID-19 pandemic as a high school student, university medical student and a non-clinical healthcare worker in Melbourne, Australia.

<h3><a href="/medicine">Medicine</a></h3>

I had always wanted to be a train driver when I was younger, but now my destiny is to be a doctor. Check out my thoughts on the content and the course, as well as the perspective of a health worker.

<h3><a href="/languages">Languages</a></h3>

My complete guides to Latin and French. Vital Chinese healthcare phrases. Observations on the English language and the evolution of scripts. The importance of language learning. History of Medical Language. Medical Etymology Instagram Page: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/medetymology">@medetymology</a></p>

<h3><a href="/projects">Programming</a></h3>

Furthermore, I've dabbled in programming language for a very long time. I'm still a novice but I'm hoping to gain skills that will help in medical research. I use python for Competitive Programming and Jekyll static site generator to build this blog.

<h3><a href="/memories">The Persistence of Memory</a></h3>

Finally, there's the personal archives, titled 'The Persistence of Memory', where I post things like reviews of films I've watched, things I've owned, TV shows I liked when I was young, objects and pictures that bring back memories of primary school etc.

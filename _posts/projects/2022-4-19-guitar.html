I've been learning the guitar recently - so here's a project I devised and am working on with HTML / JS to train myself
with less effort

    <main>
        <p>Initial observations on guitar chords (will consolidate in new post): the base note is the tonic. The third
            is crucial for major / minor distinction but often ommitted in the lower octave of a standard (two octave
            range chord). The interval between all strings except G/B is a perfect 4th. A major third is one semitone
            less than a perfect 4th, hence the recurring pattern of the third finger one fret closer to the guitar body
            compared to the index finger. (similarly with the minor third pattern in the mediant/dominant of major
            chords and tonic/mediant of minor chords.</p>
        <p>Plan: learn notes. Learn chords. Consolidate types of chords (base note differences, 7s, sustained) Practice
            chords. Practice strumming and strumming patterns.</p>

<h1><a href="/">BACK TO POONOS.COM</a></h1>

<p>I've been learning the guitar recently - so here's a project I devised and am working on with HTML / JS to train
    myself with less effort. The first version was released in April, this one is complete with chords and guitar note
    crammer. Check it out! I appreciate any and all feedback :))</p>

        <p>How to use the Note Crammer: Click Reset Colours, Hided Notes, Note Crammer, and then guess which note
            the
            green note is
            by pressing the Tonic Note options, until you get the correct one! To turn off, click Note Crammer
            again.

        <h3>Some basics of music theory intervals, using C major as an example</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Major chord = tonic, major 3rd, perfect 5th (C = C, E, G, C)</li>
            <li>Minor chord = tonic, minor 3rd (one semitone less than major 3rd, perfect 4th (Cm = C, E♭, G, C)
            </li>
            <li>Dominant seventh chord for major and minor (not the same as major seventh chord) = additional minor
                7th
                note, one tone below the tonic (C7 = C, E, G, B♭, C, Cm7= C, E♭, G, B♭, C) </li>
            <li>Sustained = replace the third note with either the 2nd or the 4th note, usually the 4th (Csus = C,
                F, G,
                C)</li>
            <li>Inverted or slash chords = play the second note as the bass note (C/E = E, C, E, G, C; C/D = D, C,
                E, G)
            </li>

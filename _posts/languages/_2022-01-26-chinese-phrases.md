I've begun to pick up Mandarin once again as I am now working in the healthcare industry apparently. I've needed to use Mandarin for the first time, and as such am excited about picking it up again (I used to attend Chinese school on weekends - it was difficult).

I'm fluent enough (I can communicate with it, but do not know more complex vocabulary) in Cantonese, so I usually try to translate parallel from my understanding of Cantonese syntax.

I can read and write only basic Simplified Chinese, which I learnt from my times doing Chinese language school. I'm grateful though, that I do have a very basic knowledge of it, and hope to develop it further.

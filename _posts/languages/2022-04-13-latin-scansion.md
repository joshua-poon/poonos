Scansion is identifying the rhythm of a line of Latin poetry. The most important aspects are the length of the vowels/syllables and the divisions within each line.

<h2>Dactylic hexameter</h2>

The Aeneid uses dactylic hexameter
hexameter: 6 feet per line

1st to 4th feet: dactyl ( _ u u ) or spondee ( _ _ )
5th foot : usually dactyl ( _  u u)
6th foot: trochee ( _ u) or spondee ( _ _ )

_ indicates a long vowel, u indicates a short vowel

<h2>Vowels</h2>
<h3>Classification</h3>
The vowels are a, e, i, o, u, y (present in Greek words)

i as the first letter of the word (usually) and followed by a vowel (usually u, a, e)
-i can become a consonant eg Iulius = Julius

i, between two vowels within a word
-eius, maior, peior, huius, Troia, cuius
-the i is a consonant and joins with the last vowel e-ius, hu-ius, Tro-ia except ai-o

diphthongs: ae, oe, ei, eu, au, ui (only in cui, cuius, huic, huius)
-combinations of two vowels to make a single sound
-not all occurrences of these vowels together are diphthongs eg puella or aer
-diphthongs are always long except when it is an open syllable (followed by another vowel); ae in praeacutus is short

<h3>Vowel classification</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<td>h</td>
<td>not a consonant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>th, ph, ch</td>
<td>a single consonant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>qu, gu (u is not a vowel, but part of the consonant)</td>
<td>a single consonant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>i, u (when followed by a vowel and at start of word)</td>
<td>can become a consonant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>pr, pl, br, tr, dr, cr, cl, gr, fr, fl (mutes b, c, d, f, g, p, t followed by liquids l, r)	</td>
<td>single consonant</td>
</tr>
</table>

A vowel is long based on its position in the sentence.

A vowel directly followed by two consonants (according to the consonant classifications above) is long. These consonants do not have to be in the same word as the vowel.

<h3>Long vowels by nature</h3>

Use the dictionary to see what endings are long by nature, at the end of a word. For example, 'i', 'o' and 'u' are usually long.

Furthermore, diphthongs are long.

<h3>Elision</h3>
Elision occurs when
-a word ends in a vowel or a vowel + m
-the next word begins with a vowel of h

The vowel ending the preceding word is puella ambulat = puellambulat

The elided vowel is never scanned. Very rarely, the poet doesnâ€™t elide the vowel for a particular effect, called a hiatus.

<h3>Caesura</h3>
A caesura is any break between words within a foot. The main caesura should be marked with two slashes ( // ). It should occur after the first (long) syllable of the foot.

-it is placed in the third foot if there is a caesura there
-otherwise it is placed in the fourth, and if not present in the fourth, the second foot

<h3>Diaresis</h3>
A diaeresis is any time the end of a word coincides with the end of a foot.

<h3>Overall guide to scansion</h3>

Remember: scansion and meter do not change the pronunciation of the line
<ol>
<li>check for elision</li>
<li>scan the 5th and 6th feet</li>
<li>mark the long by position vowels (vowel followed by two consonants)</li>
<li>mark the vowels that are long or short by nature (but not long by position already)</li>
<li>deduce the dactyls and spondees</li>
<li>use the dictionary to locate all the lengths of vowels. Only vowels which are long by nature are marked, with a macron.</li>
</ol>

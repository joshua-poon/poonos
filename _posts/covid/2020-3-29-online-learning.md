_The post was written January 22, 2022, using the mental record of my feelings, the archives I store away in my emails and Drive, and news media, including articles and news reports from Australian media outlets._

On 19 March, 2020, all students at my school received an email from the Dean of Students.

_Dear Boys,_

_Thank you for the efforts that you have made to slow the spread of COVID-19. Through washing hands, coughing and sneezing into elbows, placing tissues directly in the rubbish bins and avoiding touching your face we have been able to keep Scotch safe. We continue to follow the advice of the Australian government. This includes keeping school open until otherwise directed by an official agency or until the local environmental changes make it unsustainable. Scotch remains open and will remain open until you receive an email from the Principal informing you otherwise._

_On the school’s website (in the News Feed) we are listing events that are cancelled or postponed._

_Yesterday’s trail of online learning was a great success. We all tried a new approach and while improvements can be made, it is reassuring to know that we can make academic progress over the times ahead. We are also looking at ways that we can continue to support each other, both within our community and in the broader community. There are many people for whom this is an extremely difficult time and while we are all inconvenienced, please continue to look after those around you. If you feel you need support, then please contact your Form Teacher or Head of House, the Chaplains or the Psychologists._

_In the meantime we continue to face this situation together, taking steps forward as best as we can._

I clearly remember teachers having to go to a lecture theatre at my school one lunchtime to learn about online learning programs and how to use them.

In the few weeks before we shut down, we had learnt that many of the neighbouring private schools had shut down prophylactically, against the wishes of the Feederal Government. Government schools obviously could not shut down without direction of the State Government. The School released a statement to parents, to the effect of stating categorically that we would not shut down because it was important to follow the rules of the government.

On Monday March 23, 2020, we had 1718 infections in Australia in total, with 364 new cases across the country, and 59 new cases in Victoria. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:COVID-19_pandemic_data/Australia_medical_cases)

That morning, I was just about to walk out of the house but had luckily checked my phone before doing so. This was during a period I didn't rely heavily on my phone so was very lucky to have checked it before leaving the house. I saw an email from the School informing us that the School was closed. We received notification through email that a parent had tested positive to COVID-19. Just going through the email archives for that day, I would receive 15 emails that day, and 1534 emails that entire year, much greater than every year before that. That day, we also received notification that no test SACs would be conducted while at home, and that we would transition to remote learning for the rest of the week. That week was originally going to be our last week of Term 1.

The Victorian school holidays for government schools had been brought forward from Friday 27 March to Tuesday 24 March. (https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/schools-closed-from-tuesday-in-drastic-bid-to-curb-coronavirus-spread-20200322-p54cpw.html) However, many private schools, such as my one, continued to run online classes during this week, which helped make us familiar with the systems. This would be one of the advantages being at a private school during the pandemic conferred upon us VCE students. At this time, we were using a program attached to our Learning Management System called Big Blue Button. We would later move to Zoom meetings.

Over the next few days, my Head of House encouraged us while we were at home, sending us pictures of the new school building, and other emails periodically with trivial aspects of working at home life (many of our teachers would transition to remote learning too). An email from Thursday 26 March makes reference to my Housemaster's pet dog.

_The post was written January 22, 2022, using the mental record of my feelings, the archives I store away in my emails and Drive, and news media, including articles and news reports from Australian media outlets._

I distinctly remember the beginning of 2020. The year began very awkwardly on a number of fronts, and this was before we had even heard of the virus. I was working my retail job over the summer break and had taken leave to go interstate with my family.

I remember very clearly first hearing the news about the COVID-19 pandemic while on the trip. I had thought that it would be something that would come up and die back down very quickly, and I made this known to those around me. How lacking in foresight I was! This was true for a very short amount of time - we had a couple of cases enter Australia late January, before the whole issue seemingly dying down for a couple of weeks.

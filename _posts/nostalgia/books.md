When I was younger, I was really into reading books. 

Zac Power
Rainbow Magic. I was the only boy who read these books at my primary school.
Geronimo Stilton
Famous Five + Secret Seven + Five Find Outers + Naughtiest Girl
Harry Potter - the order I read these books wa around 2, 7, 3, 4, 1, 6, 5. I used to know the exact order. I will never again be able to say for certain what the exact order is.
Lord of the Rings + Jane Austen
Sherlock Holmes
Bridge to Terabithia + Tuck Everlasting + Harry Potter (some WiseOnes thing)
Emily Rodda - Deltora Quest, Three Doors
Jackie French books
When Hitler Killed Pink Rabbit
Roald Dahl
Agatha Christie
My reading dwindled towards the latter half of high school, except for a spike in Year 12. Lockdown gave me time and energy to read again, which was great.

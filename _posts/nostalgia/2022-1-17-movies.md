This is a mostly comprehensive list of all films I've watched. The vast majority of the films I've watched are at the cinemas, normally Village, or on free-to-air commercial TV. I also watched many films during classes in both primary school and high school. In high school, we mainly watched films in Christian Education and English. In primary school we watched films during class, and we also went on a couple of excursions.

As I usually book the tickets when going to the cinemas, I also did a search of my emails and found the films I had booked tickets for.

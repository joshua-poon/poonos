Y'know in primary school when we go on school camps. Every time we finished one of those,  have some sort of sad sort of longing - for the memories we had but would never experience again, and also a sense of happiness about returning home to our families. That's what I'm experiencing right now as I take the V-Line train home from Bendigo with a friend, after a week of 'rural' placement in Bendigo. I'm tired (4.5 hours of sleep last night) and doing an assignment on malaria (mosquitoes are the animal kingdom's biggest killer of humans), but reflecting on the trip will give me some closure on what has been the longest time away from home that I've been.

#### Sunday

On Sunday, A's mum drove us to Southern  cross. I was so tired as I had been doing the RESN BBQ at Westfield Doncaster. We almost missed the 5:06 train to Bendigo because of Maccas, but after a bit of jogging we made it just in time. There was someone on the train without a ticket and we waited at a station to take them off. The train was fast and cheap.

We then went to buy at Coles. I forked out 50 dollars for groceries, which was way higher than I expected.

Then that night I called and chatted with people and went to bed at like 3.

#### Monday

On Monday we attended a smoking ceremony, explored Monash rural health where there was a nice common room.

#### Tuesday

Tuesday we attended clinical skills where we did suturing, cannula and blood practice. Then we went to the hospital, where Daniel took me around. It was very clean and new. that night people went gokarting but I stated at home and are pasta. 

#### Wednesday

Today I went to the GP. I watched some procedures,

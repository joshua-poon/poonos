It's so interesting how sometimes, I'll have a random recollection of something I used to do. When I was younger and my family went to restaurants, we used to play mastermind (basically Worldle with colours), chess and read. We also used to bring pieces of paper and play pen soccer, which is where we started in the centre, and in turn, flicked a pen from the position of the ball, to the new position of the ball, in an attempt to score the opposite goal.

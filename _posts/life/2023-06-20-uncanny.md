I was with my friend the other day and we were talking about old books and we both remembered a story from 'Greensleaves' about a whale that Paul Jennings wrote. I searched it up and it was in his collection 'uncanny'.

It's facinating how many shared memories people have. Simply growing up in the same city and country, we share so many common interests, books and stories, mutuals, memory of significant events etc.
